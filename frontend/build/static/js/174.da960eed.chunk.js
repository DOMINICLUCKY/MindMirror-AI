Our technology combines NLP (Natural Language Processing) with psychological research to give you actionable insights about your emotional health."},{question:"\ud83c\udfaf How does the emotion detection work?",answer:"When you journal your thoughts and feelings, our AI analyzes the text to identify 6 core emotional states: stressed, tired, anxious, happy, confused, and angry. The system evaluates sentiment patterns, stress indicators, and emotional frequency to create a comprehensive emotional profile. This analysis helps predict burnout risk and recommend personalized coping strategies."},{question:"\ud83d\udcdd Do I need to journal daily?",answer:"While daily journaling provides the most accurate insights, you can use MindMirror AI at your own pace. Even 2-3 entries per week can help identify emotional patterns. More frequent entries (daily or multiple times per day) will give you better predictions and more personalized recommendations."},{question:"\ud83d\udd10 Is my data private and secure?",answer:"Yes! Your privacy is our top priority. All journal entries are encrypted and stored securely on our servers. We never share your personal data with third parties. You can delete your account and all associated data at any time from the Settings page."}]},{category:"Features & Analytics",items:[{question:"\ud83d\udcca What do the burnout metrics mean?",answer:"Our burnout score (0-100%) is calculated using multiple factors: sentiment trends (40%), stress/anxiety levels (30%), fatigue indicators (20%), and historical patterns (10%). A score above 70% indicates critical burnout risk and we recommend seeking professional help. Below 50% suggests healthy emotional balance."},{question:"\ud83d\udca1 What are AI recommendations?",answer:"Based on your emotional patterns, our AI generates 3-tier recommendations: Tier 1 are immediate wellness activities (meditation, breaks), Tier 2 are lifestyle changes (exercise, sleep), and Tier 3 are professional support suggestions (therapy, counseling). Recommendations update with new journal entries."},{question:"\ud83d\udcc8 How accurate is the emotion detection?",answer:"Our AI achieves 85%+ accuracy in emotion detection after analyzing thousands of anonymized journal entries. However, it works best when you're honest and detailed in your entries. The system learns your personal emotional patterns over time, improving accuracy with more data."},{question:"\ud83c\udfa8 What does the dashboard show?",answer:"The dashboard displays: Emotion frequency pie chart, Sentiment trend over time, Weekly burnout risk, Recommended actions, and Personal wellness statistics. Charts update automatically as you add new journal entries."}]},{category:"Account & Settings",items:[{question:"\ud83d\udd04 How do I change my password?",answer:"Go to Settings > Account Security > Change Password. You'll need to verify your current password before setting a new one. Passwords must be at least 8 characters with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, and numbers for security."},{question:"\ud83c\udf19 What is dark mode?",answer:"Dark mode reduces eye strain during night journaling sessions by using darker backgrounds and lighter text. Toggle it on/off in Settings > Display > Dark Mode. Your preference is saved automatically across all devices when you're logged in."},{question:"\ud83d\udd14 How do I manage notifications?",answer:"Visit Settings > Notifications to customize: daily reminder times, burnout alerts, achievement notifications, and website updates. You can enable/disable any notification type and set preferred delivery times."},{question:"\ud83d\udcf1 Can I use MindMirror on mobile?",answer:"MindMirror AI is fully responsive and works on all devices (phones, tablets, computers).
